By now, I should have provided you 4 jpg images that you will use for this pratical example. At any point, you have any questions or issues, please reach out to me.

### Steps by Steps:
1. Create an html file called pattern
2. Creating a navbar
  * Insert a navbar using [BootStrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navbar/).
  * You will have to choose the correct navbar class that will match with the example. Hint: Look for a dark navbar.
  * Insert the binoculars inside the navbar-brand. To do this: you will need to call the Font Awesome Library. The Font Awesome library is a free tool that has thousands of icons that developers use.
  * Insert inside the head:
  <link href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet"  type='text/css'>
