![Pattern Website Final Version](https://github.com/laiamanda/web-dev101/blob/main/bootstrap101/pattern/pattern.PNG)

By now, I should have provided you 4 jpg images that you will use for this pratical example. At any point, you have any questions or issues, please reach out to me.

### Steps by Steps:
1. Create an html file called pattern
2. Create a navbar
   * Insert a navbar using [BootStrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navbar/).
   * You will have to choose the correct navbar class that will match with the example. Hint: Look for a dark navbar.
   * Insert the binoculars inside the navbar. To do this: you will need to call the Font Awesome Library. The Font Awesome library is a free tool that has thousands of icons that developers use.
   * Insert inside the head:
   * ```
     <link href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet"  type='text/css'>
   * [Font Awesome for Binoculars](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icon/binoculars)
Please reach out to me when you have gotton to this part.

3. Create the header section
   * First to create a section, you will need to use the ```<section>``` tags.
   * Insert the jumbotron class [jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/jumbotron/) for your section.
   * The Header is using ```<h1>``` with the class of ```display-#```
   * The ```<p>``` has a class that is shown in the documentation. Please refer to the documentation to find the class.
   * There are 2 link tags ```<a>``` with the [button bootstrap class](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/buttons/)
   * To insert the image as the background:
     1. Inside the ```<section>```, create an ```id="header"```
     2. Using Internal CSS, call upon the header id and have its css has ```background: url("header.jpeg") center center / cover no-repeat;```
