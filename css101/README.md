# Assignment

Your task is to take your fake dating user creation form from the previous assignment and add external CSS Styling. Your assignment doesn't have to look like mine, but feel free to take inspiration if needed.

# Tasks:
1. Using External CSS:
   * Change the Company's Name to any color of your choosing
   * Add a border to your form, feel free to round the edges if you like
   * Center the form
   * Add padding and margin to the form or input
   * Style the submit button to your choosing
   * For the button, add a hover animation to change it's color, and add a pointer to it. (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.php)
   * Using Google Font: Add a font family and use it. (https://fonts.google.com/)  

It can look like this:
