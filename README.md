# Web Development 101

## Objective:
To learn the structure of web development. How to style a web page. How to create functions that make a web page dynamic and no longer static. At the end, you will have created your own portfolio, and it will be hosted on github, and a game.

This course will be very quick paced, because of that it is important that you practice on your own. I will provide some “assignments” that I want you to try on your own (If there is time during our session, we can work on it at that moment). The assignments will be based on the previous lessons. The assignments aren’t there to challenge you, but it’s there for extra practice that lets you have some creative control. I will ask if you tried it, and show it to me. The assignments shouldn’t take more than 4 hours of your time.

Each assignment, I will provide an example that I want you to recreate with your own flare. These assignments should be simple and fun. Always try but if you get stuck within 2 hours on the same issue, feel free to message me on providing hints or directions to get you back on track.
